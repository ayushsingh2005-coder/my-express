This repository contains my detailed study notes on Express.js, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced implementations.
index.js is the main file or the entry file .
Each topic includes:

Clear explanations with comments
Practical code examples
Real-world use cases
Best practices and common patterns

üõ†Ô∏è Code Style & Documentation
All notes follow a consistent format with:
javascript// Clear explanations of what each method does
// ‚û§ app.get(path, callback) - handles GET requests
// ‚û§ app.post(path, callback) - handles POST requests
// ‚û§ app.put(path, callback) - handles PUT requests
// ‚û§ app.delete(path, callback) - handles DELETE requests

// Detailed comments explaining the purpose
// express() internally uses the http module under the hood
// It is same as creating a http server using .createServer() method in node.js
